LevityDash aims to be a lightweight, desktop native, multisource dashboard without a required web frontend. The current version only supports PySide2/Qt. However, a key goal of this project is to support multiple frontends and
platforms, including embedded.

*Note: This project is very much in the proof of concept stage â€“ it functions, but it is far from the goal of a lightweight dashboard.*
