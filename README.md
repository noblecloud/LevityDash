LevityDash aims to be a lightweight, desktop native, multi-source dashboard without a required web frontend that is fun and easy to use. The current version only supports PySide2/Qt. However, a key goal of this project is to support
multiple frontends and
platforms, including embedded.

*Note: This project is very much in the proof of concept stage â€“ it functions, but it is far from the goal of a lightweight dashboard.*
