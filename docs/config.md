# Config

The config for Levity currently uses python's built in config parser. Eventually, this will be replaced with TOML or YAML. The location of the config folder is platform specific so the easiest way access it is by clicking the option in the
File menu.

## Platform Specific Config Locations  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

<!-- tabs:start -->

#### **Linux**

```bash
~/.local/share/LevityDash
```

#### **macOS**

```bash
~/Library/Application Support/LevityDash
```

#### **Windows**

```bash
%APPDATA%\LevityDash\LevityDash
```

<!-- tabs:end -->

## Location  <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

This section is pretty self explanatory. If blank, Levity will guess the location based on the devices IP address.

```ini
[Location]
timezone = America/New_York
latitude = 37.8
longitude = -76.1
```

## Display

```ini
[Display]
dashboard = default.levity
frontend = Qt
fullscreen = False
width = 90%
height = 600px
```

#### <div class=mono>dashboard:</div>

The file name or path of the default dashboard.

#### <div class=mono>frontend:</div>

The frontend that Levity will use. Currently, only PySide2 is supported.

#### <div class=mono>fullscreen:</div>

When ```True```, Levity will run in fullscreen mode.

#### <div class=mono>width/height:</div>

The starting width and height of the window in pixels `px`, percentage `%`, centimeters `cm`, millimeters `mm`, inches `in` or pretty much any length unit supported by WeatherUnits. For values without a unit, integers are assumed to be
pixels and floats, percentages.
If provided a real-world measurement like centimeters, the value will be estimated based on the displays reported DPI.

> [!TIP]
> Using real-world measurements is handy when you are customizing/testing a dashboard that will be used on a different, smaller display

## Frontend Specific Config

### Qt

```ini
[QtOptions]
openGL = True
antialiasing = True
antialiasingSamples = 8
maxTextureSize = 10mb
pixmapCacheSize = 200mb
```

#### <div class=mono>openGL:</div>

When ```True```, Levity will use OpenGL for rendering allowing for hardware acceleration and a much faster rendering performance.

#### <div class=mono>antialiasing:</div>

When ```True```, Levity will use antialiasing for rendering.

#### <div class=mono>antialiasingSamples:</div>

The number of samples to use for antialiasing. This is only applicable when openGL is enabled. Optionally, `antialiasing` and `antialiasingSamples` can be combined to a single option, where `0` is considered disabled and any non-zero
value is the number of samples to use.

#### <div class=mono>maxTextureSize:</div>

The maximum size of textures in `[giga|mega|kilo]bytes`. This is currently only used by the Graph display module. Each graph item is rendered and stored as a bitmap in memory. Depending on the length of the timeseries plotted, size of the
dashboard, and pixel density of the display, these can get rather large which cause stuttering while scrolling. If the bitmap is larger than `maxTextureSize`, it will be scaled down to fit within the maximum size and then scaled back up to
the original size.

> [!TIP]
> Since this is a tradeoff between performance and visual fidelity. For dashboards that will not be interacted with, as long as the device can support it, the large the value the better.

#### <div class=mono>pixmapCacheSize:</div>

The maximum size of the pixmap cache in `[giga|mega|kilo]bytes`. A few of the Qt modules, except items that render their own textures like Graph Plots, use caching to speed up performance and reduce redundant rendering. All of these bitmaps
are stored in a QPixmapCache, this option limits the size of that cache.

## Fonts

```ini
[Fonts]
default = Nunito
default.weight = Medium
compact = Nunito
compact.weight = Medium
```

This is where you can define the default font and it's properties. The default font will be used wherever the font is not explicitly defined.
The compact font is used when the text will be rendered in space with a height less than 120px. Eventually, this threshold will be adjustable by the user.

## Logging

```ini
[Logging]
level = INFO
verbosity = 0
encoding = utf-8
logFileFormat = %%Y-%%m-%%d_%%H-%%M-%%S
logFileWidth = 120

maxLogFolderSize = 200mb
maxLogAge = 7 days
rolloverSize = 10mb
rolloverCount = 5

prettyErrors = False
maxPrettyErrorsFolderSize = 50mb
```

#### <div class=mono>level:</div>

The logging level to use. This can be one of the following: `VERBOSE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL` with the default being `INFO`. This only changes the level of logging that is written to the console. The log file is
always written at the `VERBOSE` level with a verbosity of `5`.

#### <div class=mono>verbosity:</div>

The verbosity threshold for the `VERBOSE` level. This is a number between 0 and 5. The higher the number, the more verbose the log file. The default is `0`.

#### <div class=mono>encoding:</div>

The encoding to use for the log file. The default is `utf-8`.

#### <div class=mono>logFileFormat:</div>

The format of the log file name It is a typical `strftime` format string. The default is `%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S`.
> [!TIP]
> https://strftime.org/ is a wonderful cheatsheet for formatting dates and times. Placing a `-` between the `%` and the specifying digit like so `%-I` will remove leading zeros. The only consideration that needs to be made is when running
> on Windows, the correct character is `#` instead of `-`. A lot of the time, Levity will handle this for you, but it is not implemented everywhere.

#### <div class=mono>logFileWidth:</div>

The width in characters of the log file. For log levels higher than VERBOSE, the default of 120 is plenty. Depending on the verbosity level, it might need to be expanded for readability.

#### <div class=mono>maxLogFolderSize:</div>

The maximum size of the log folder in `[giga|mega|kilo]bytes`. When the log folder reaches this size, the oldest log files will be deleted until the folder size is less than the specified size. The default is `200mb`.

#### <div class=mono>maxLogAge:</div>

The maximum age of the error log file in days. When the log file reaches this age, it will be rolled over to a new file. The default is `7 days`.
accepts: `[int|float][days|weeks|months|years]` or any variation/abbreviation. Additionally, a string representation of a dict can also be provided here. This allows for more fine-tuned age cutoffs since you can combine measurements with
both positive and negative values.

#### Example

```python
"{'seconds': -30, 'minutes': 15, 'hours': -12, 'days': 10}"
```

#### <div class=mono>rolloverSize:</div>

The logger uses a rolling file logger, when the log file reaches this size, it will be rolled over to a new file. Like the other memory size parameters, values are given as `[giga|mega|kilo]bytes`. The default is `10mb`.

#### <div class=mono>rolloverCount:</div>

This is the number of files to keep with the rolling file logger. The default is `5`.

#### <div class=mono>prettyErrors:</div>

When `True`, Levity will use a pretty error handler that will output the traceback and local variables to a syntax highlighted HTML file. It isn't the most practical feature, so it's set to `False` by default. However, it comes in handy
when helping debug issues with someone not accustomed to reading error messages and tracebacks.

#### <div class=mono>maxPrettyErrorsFolderSize:</div>

The maximum size of the folder where pretty error files are stored. This is only used when `prettyErrors` is `True`. The default is `50mb`.

## WeatherUnits <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

The sections below are for the WeatherUnit Module. WeatherUnits is what is used to convert/localize measurements for display. More information on how it's configured can be found in
the [WeatherUnits repo](https://github.com/noblecloud/WeatherUnits).

```ini
[Units]
wind = mi/hr
temperature = f
precipitationRate = inch/*
precipitationHourly = inch/hr
precipitation = inch
pressure = inHg
density = lbs/ft
pollutionDensity = ug/m
length = mi

[UnitDefaults]
precision = 1
max = 3

[UnitProperties]
temperature = precision=0, max=3, unitSpacer=False, shorten=False, kSeparator=True, decorator=ยบ, showUnit=False
```
