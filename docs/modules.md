# Modules

There are several modules already available for use. However, you can also build your own.

## Realtime

Single line text with support for showing units and titles and mapping glyphs/emojis to values

## Graph

### Figures

A figure is a collection of plots. Figures can be resized within the graph and contain multiple plot types. Generally figure is limited to categorically similar values such as temperature, dewpoint, and apparent temperature.

### Plots

#### Line

Any scalar value can be plotted as a line. The line can be colored by a scalar value or by a categorical value. Coloring can also be a value mapped gradient.

#### Bar
