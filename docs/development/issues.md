## Fixing an issue

If you're the type willing to get your hands dirty, feel free to fork the project on GitHub and submit a pull request. I am slowly working on proper code documentation but in the meantime, feel free to shame my lack of documentation in
the [repo's discussions](https://github.com/noblecloud/LevityDash/discussions).
