LevityDashboard is a lightweight, easy to use, desktop native, highly customizable, multi-source dashboard written in Python.
Since Levity is desktop native and uses Qt as the primary frontend it does not use require a web browser to run nor is it a bloated Electron app.
However, a key goal of this project is to support multiple frontends and platforms, including embedded.
It can easily be deployed on a Raspberry Pi, or similar single board computer.
