# Intro <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

LevityDash lightweight, desktop native, fully modular, multi-source dashboard without a required web frontend. The current version only supports PySide2/Qt. However, a key goal of this project is to support multiple frontends and
platforms, including embedded. It can easily be deployed on a Raspberry Pi, or similar single board computer.

*Note: This project is very much in the proof of concept stage â€“ it functions, but it is far from the goal of a lightweight dashboard.*

# Quick Start

Install with pip:

```bash
pip install LevityDash
```

If you have your `$PATH` set correctly, you can run it directly with:

```bash
LevityDash
```

Otherwise, it can be run as with the module flag:

```bash
python -m LevityDash
```
